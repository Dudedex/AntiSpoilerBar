# AntiSpoilerBar

This is an overlay to prevent spoilers from other games or the current game itself if you watch the replay in the american football gamepass

To use it just copy the content of the file bookmarklet.txt into the url bar of a browser bookmarklet.

If this is done, you can open the gamepass and click on the bookmarklet to activate or deactivate the overlay.
